# comp-ling
Simulating the game telepathy between two language models trained on different datasets to see if convergence can be reached.
A project in computational linguistics attempting to understand biases that may be associated with the difference in data sources. Word association is used as a vessel through which to demonstrate the compounding differences and consequences associated with limited data input.

Note: Make sure to download datasets on your end, they are not included in the repo purely because of sheer size.
